Website: https://zydico.github.io/portfolio/

This is my portfolio website that was developed using React, Next.js, Tailwind, Typescript, HTML, and CSS.

Initially built using Angular, I decided to build a new portfolio website from scratch using React after seeing that React has grown massively in popularity recently.
